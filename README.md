# Personal Site Template

A minimalist template for a personal site based on Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

Cloned from the [athena template by broccolini](https://github.com/broccolini/athena), changes to design inspired by [Omkar Pathak's personal site](https://github.com/OmkarPathak/omkarpathak.github.io).
> Note: Significant modifications were made with AI assistance.

## Setup
Install Ruby: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/

Add path to Ruby gem bin folder to PATH (note: your path and Ruby version may differ):
```bash
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/lib/ruby/gems/4.0.0/bin:$PATH"
```

Install Jekyll and Bundler:
```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```

Clone your fork of this repo (replace the URL below with your own fork's, not the original):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
```

Navigate to repo folder:
```bash
cd <your-repo-name>
```

Install dependencies (defined in Gemfile, may require modification if version incompatibilities arise):
```bash
bundle install
```

**IMPORTANT: in `_config.yml`, set `url`, `baseurl`, `github_repo`, and `github_username` to match your own GitHub Pages deployment**
```yaml
url: "https://<your-username>.github.io" # the domain GitHub Pages will serve your site at
baseurl: "/<your-repo-name>" # leave this blank if this is your user site
github_repo: <your-repo-name>
github_username: <your-username>
```

Run the website locally:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
